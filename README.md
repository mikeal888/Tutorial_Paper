# README for Quantum Current Fluctuations Tutorial

This repository contains the tutorial for understanding and analyzing quantum current fluctuations. The tutorial aims to provide a unified toolbox for describing current fluctuations in continuously measured quantum systems. The tools and techniques used to describe these fluctuations are scattered across different communities, and this tutorial brings them together to provide novel insights and practical analytical and numerical tools.

You can find the arXiv preprint of the tutorial [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04270). There are several python and mathematica notebooks that accompany the tutorial. The notebooks are organized as follows:

### Python 
Here we provide the python code for the tutorial. The primary functions are defined in FCS.py which can be imported into other notebooks. The notebooks are organized according to the examples in the tutorial. 

### Mathematica
Here we provide the mathematica code for the tutorial. The primary functions are defined defined in melt.nb and are demonstrated in Examples (public).nb.
