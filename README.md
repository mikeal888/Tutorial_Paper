# README for Quantum Current Fluctuations Tutorial

This repository contains the tutorial for understanding and analyzing quantum current fluctuations. The tutorial aims to provide a unified toolbox for describing current fluctuations in continuously measured quantum systems. The tools and techniques used to describe these fluctuations are scattered across different communities, and this tutorial brings them together to provide novel insights and practical analytical and numerical tools.

You can find the arXiv preprint of the tutorial [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.04270). There are several python and Mathematica notebooks that accompany the tutorial. All the examples in these notebooks are organized according to the tutorial's convention, that is A, B, C, and D. The physical and mathematical details of each example can be found in Sec. 2B. 

The mathematical details underpinning each of these notebooks can be found throughout the tutorial, but there is a strong emphasis on Sec. 4 Full Counting Statistics, and Sec. 5 Solution Methods.

### Python 
Here we provide the python code for the tutorial. 

The following packages are required to run the code in this tutorial:

- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scipy`
- `qutip`

To install these packages, you can use pip:

`pip install numpy matplotlib scipy qutip`

The primary functions are defined in FCS.py which can be imported into other notebooks.

### Mathematica
Here we provide the Mathematica code for the tutorial. The primary functions are defined in melt.nb and are demonstrated in Examples (public).nb and are organized according to the tutorial. You can also find many more additional examples discussed in the Examples (public) notebook.

You can find further details about the melt package at the following [website](https://melt1.notion.site/melt1/Melt-2d05fca5cfa342e28cafaf6fe26e049e).
